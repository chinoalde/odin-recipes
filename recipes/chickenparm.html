    <h3>Italian-American Staple!</h3>
    <p>My version of chicken Parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a 
        crispier crust.</p>
    <p>Recipe by <strong>Chef John</strong></p>

        <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags
                 work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.
                  Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. 
                Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden,
                 about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil,
                 and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
